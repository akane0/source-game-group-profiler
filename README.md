# source-game-group-profiler
Takes in a player's steam URL then tries to find if they are friends with anyone in the server they are in.

Option to also look up their friend's friends.

Will only work if the user's profile is public, and are also sharing game data.

**Known issues:**
- If a user's friend has the exact same name as someone in the server they are in, they will be added to the group
